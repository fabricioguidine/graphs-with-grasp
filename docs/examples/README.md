# Examples and Reference Code

This directory contains reference implementations and example code from the original project.

## Structure

```
examples/
├── reference-code/          # Original model code template
│   ├── Graph.h/cpp
│   ├── Node.h/cpp
│   ├── Edge.h/cpp
│   └── main.cpp
└── trabalhografos-master/   # Original project implementation
    ├── include/
    ├── src/
    └── main.cpp
```

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference purposes to understand the original implementation approach. They are not part of the active codebase.

## Note

The current implementation is in the `src/` and `include/` directories. These examples are maintained for historical reference and learning purposes only.
