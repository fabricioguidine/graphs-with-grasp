# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived code and old versions from the original project structure.

## Structure

```
archive/
├── code/                    # Reference and model code
│   ├── reference/           # Reference implementations and templates
│   └── trabalhografos-master/ # Original project code
├── versions/                # Old project versions

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference and historical purposes. They represent the original codebase before the project restructure.

## Note

The current implementation is in the `src/` and `include/` directories. This archive is maintained for reference only and is not part of the active codebase.
